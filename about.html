                    <h2>Welcome to my site!</h2>
                    Hi, my name is Andy! You may know me as Andoiii on the Internet - with 1,3,4, or even 8 i's, depending on what's available.
                    Welcome to this little section of the Internet that I sliced off from the GitHub and made my own.
                    Feel free to take a look at my projects, resume, and skills on their own pages.

                    <h2>Who are you?</h2>
                    I am a third year university student studying Computer Science and Business Administration.
                    It is a double degree program - Computer Science through the University of Waterloo; Business Administration through Wilfrid Laurier University.
                    I don't have much prior experience in either of these fields - but I am eager to learn more and explore what it's all about?

                    <h2>What is your background then?</h2>
                    I used to do a lot of maths back in high school. Lots of contests, mainly those through the CEMC. In Grade 9, I managed to score Top 15 Nationally in Canada in the CIMC, which was cool.
                    I also am very passionate about tutoring maths, and have been tutoring peers and younger students since 14.

                    <h2>What are your hobbies?</h2>
                    Instead of having real hobbies I play Old School Runescape. It's a fun game, and I'm perpetually close to maxxing.
                    I like to doodle sometimes, though my drawing style looks like its drawn by a 10 year old.
                    I attend business case competitions and hackathons occasionally in university - they are very engaging and fun to do with friends.

                    <h2>What do you do as a coding person?</h2>
                    I've been focusing on Web Development for now - JS, React and what not.
                    Outside that, I'm not too sure what to specialize in (or even if I should!). I dream of making a game one day, but never can find the time; and I want to look at other fields of Computer Science too...
                    Hell, maybe one day I'll learn Rust. I think it would be fitting.
                    Either way, for now I think I'll just go with the flow and where it takes me.

                    <h2>What do you do as a business person?</h2>
                    Good question.
                    In addition to finanical literacy, we learn about corporate strategy, the legal environment, mix in a bit of psychology, and frameworks of thinking...
                    Business is in many ways completely different to CS, and the fact I can take both sometimes feels like a shotgun marriage.
                    However, I think Business is still worth developing an understanding for, and good for balancing the heavy math work I do with CS.
                    At other times, I like to lament the failings of capitalism.

                    <div>Q: Are you real? A: Uh... yes, I think. How about you?</div>
                    <div>Q: Are you in FAANG yet? A: No. One day, perhaps.</div>
                    <div>Q: Why are you taking 2 degrees at once? A: Not a day goes by where I don't ask myself that exact question. Perhaps it is for job stability, perhaps it is the sunk cost fallacy.
                        Regardless, I'm happy with where I'm at. I've found a local maximum, per se.
                    </div> 
                    <div>Q: Where are you from? A: Canada, Hong Kong, or China are all valid answers. Take your pick.</div>
                    <div>Q: Do you watch anime? A: (Un)fortunately, no I do not.</div>
                    <div>Q: Do you pay your taxes? A: Yes, I am a law abiding citizen. You can trust my word when I say I have not commited tax fraud. Why would I ever? I love the government and would never ever steal from &lt;Insert Current Canadian Prime Minister here&gt; </Current></div>
